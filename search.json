These events are sensitive indicators of climate variability and change.\nThroughout the semester, students in the Earth, Environment, and Climate Lab (GEO105) at the University at Buffalo monitor trees on North Campus and upload observations to Nature’s Notebook and the USA National Phenology Network. This site summarizes those observations.\nThese data were last updated on 2025-12-21 20:23:59.124958."
